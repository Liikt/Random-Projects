This sortingalgorithm came into my mind while talking with some friends at university about dumb 
sortingalgorithms (i.e. bogosort or stacksort). It basically checks with a chance of 50% if the 
array is sorted. If not there is another 50% chance that two random entries in the list will be 
swaped. To be honest I don't know what the actual avarage runtime is, but it's way to much. The 
compare function compares the needed instructions (far better method of comparing than actual 
runtime) with the needed instructions of bubblesort. 

Edit (19.04.2016):
An already sorted array takes at least 14 instructions to compare. Otherwise I think the O 
notation is pretty much useless.
